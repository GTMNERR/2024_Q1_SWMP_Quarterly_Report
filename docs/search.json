    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring Program\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

    "text": "1.1 Station Information\nThe continuous water quality component of the SWMP is comprised of four fixed monitoring stations, at which automated instruments (data sondes) are deployed to continuously collect information on a suite of water quality parameters. Discrete water samples are collected monthly for nutrients and other parameters at these same four stations, with an additional diel sampler deployed at one station. To complement the water quality data, the GTMNERR also operates and maintains one continuous meteorological station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll SWMP data are publicly available for download through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO). The CDMO supports data management protocols for SWMP and is responsible for ensuring that SWMP data are of high quality and accessible online (https://www.nerrsdata.org)."

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions. The weather station is located near the mouth of Pellicer Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: SWMP Water Quality Stations"

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold. Both grab and diel samples were collected from the approximate depth of the sonde sensors, 1 m above the bottom. Samples were filtered in the field whenever feasible; otherwise, they were placed on ice in the dark and filtered immediately upon returning to the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Grab sample collection using sampling pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Diel sampler deployed at Pellicer Creek station.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Collection methods for nutrient analyses\n\n\nWater samples collected between January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2010 were collected and analyzed by University of Florida’s (UF) Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

    "section": "",
    "text": "From 2003–2006, SWMP data underwent a two-step QA/QC process (secondary and tertiary) using protocols outlined in the CDMO’s Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2006). The secondary QA/QC process was performed by GTMNERR staff and involved performing basic statistical analysis, processing the data using macros distributed by the CDMO, and plotting data to look for suspect or anomalous data. Anomalous data were evaluated to determine whether values were: 1) outside the expected range for the site, or 2) outside the range of measurements established by YSI for the sensors. Data were investigated for validity based on weather and field observations, quality control checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Yearly data files were compiled, and data were deleted if anomalies were attributed to sensor malfunctions. Other anomalous data were marked as suspect in the accompanying yearly metadata document. Both the annual data file and metadata were submitted to the CDMO for archiving and review. The CDMO evaluated the reserve’s findings by performing a tertiary review process. The tertiary process included evaluating the files for completeness, ensuring that supporting documentation was submitted, and offering suggestions for improvements to the data. All data files collected prior to 2007 are referred to as “historic” data files by the CDMO. Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to present, all SWMP data files undergo a three-step QA/QC protocol outlined in the CDMO Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2015). In addition to the secondary and tertiary processes listed above, data files undergo a primary QA/QC process, in which an automated QA/QC is performed by the CDMO upon the upload of the raw data file using the CDMO’s Data Upload Service.\nOnce tertiary review is completed for data files, they are referred to as “authenticated” data. All data files used in this report have been authenticated with the exception of nutrient data collected in 2013 and 2015-present, which have not undergone tertiary review. Historic data files were edited to include the updated QA/QC protocols that were implemented by the CDMO in 2007. Standardized QA/QC flags and codes were applied to the historic data files using finalized metadata reports. These files were updated to include suspect data flags and codes to keep consistency among all data files. Rejected and suspect data were removed from the data files prior to analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll water quality and weather data used in this report are downloadable through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office using their data portals. However, much of the nutrient data presented in this report is not fully available through the CDMO. For those wishing to access this data, please contact the GTM Research Reserve SWMP Manager Shannon Dunnigan at Shannon.Dunnigan@FloridaDEP.gov for the data."

January had the greatest amount of rainfall at 106.2 mm (Figure 4.1 (b)), and the greatest number of rain days exceeding 10 mm/day (Figure 4.1 (c)).\nWinter storm Finn (unofficially named) brought rainfall and strong winds in January to Northeast Florida causing some local schools to release students early and cancel after school activities (Figure 4.1 (a); Figure 4.1 (b)). These events are discussed in further detail in the next chapter.\nIn 2024, the average daily amount of light intensity for each month is shown in Figure 4.2. Light intensity increased each month with the lowest peak daily amount of light in January and the highest in March. The greatest light intensity in March occurred mid-day and exceeded January???s intensity by over 10,000 mMol/m^2.\nDaily average air temperatures were variable during the first part of the year but fell within the historical range for the GTMNERR station through March (Figure 4.3). January and March experienced a few temperature drops outside of the average range (Figure 4.3). More discussions on temperature anomalies can be found in the next chapter.\nDaily averages in water temperature generally fell within historical ranges at the stations within the quarter, but all stations experienced lower temperature in January and higher temperatures in February and March (Figure 4.4). The changes in daily averages were observed at all four stations, though more pronounced at Pellicer Creek, the shallowest of the four stations (Figure 4.4 (d)).\nRainfall in January brought salinities lower than their average daily ranges (Figure 4.5), particularly at the stations farthest from the inlets (Figure 4.5 (a); Figure 4.5 (d)). Salinities stayed below the average daily range at Pine Island for the entire quarter but increased at the other stations. All stations with the exception of San Sebastian (Figure 4.5 (b)) had increasing salinities in March."

In previous years dissolved oxygen values at Pine Island (Figure 5.2 (a)) and Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.3 (a)) frequently fell below the 2 mg/L hypoxia threshold but so far in 2024 there have not been any low dissolved oxygen events (Figure 5.2 (b), (Figure 5.3 (b)).\nChlorophyll a values were often higher than average at all stations this year (Figure 5.4). Chlorophyll a values at all stations fell below state thresholds in January (Figure 5.4). Elevated chlorophyll a was observed at San Sebastian for February and March (Figure 5.4 (b)) and at Pellicer Creek in March (Figure 5.4 (d)). Annual geometric mean (AGM) chlorophyll a values were high and above the state threshold levels at San Sebastian (Figure 5.5), (Figure 5.5 (b)). These values have been consistantly elevated since 2018. Pine Island and Pellicer showed a decrease in AGM for 2024 from elevated values in 2023 (Figure 5.5 (a)), (Figure 5.5 (d)); however, the AGM will likely change for all stations as more data is added throughout the year.\nPine Island was the only station in the first quarter of 2024 that had elevated TN data. Data at Pine Island exceeded the state threshold of 0.65 mg/L in January and March (Figure 5.6), (Figure 5.6 (a)). All four stations had missing TN data for February.

Lower than average values were observed at San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek in February (Figure 5.8). Pine Island was missing TKN data for February.\nTotal phosphorus fell below the state threshold for all the stations in the first quarter of 2024 with the exception of February at Pine Island which was missing data (Figure 5.9).

At post-calibration it gave “internal battery voltage is below 0.9V per cell” error and after replacing with alternative batteries, passed post-calibration checks. Evaluation revealed no issue with with the sensors or sonde itself. YSI Service Technicians recommended redeploying the sonde in the lab for a couple of days and check the data for rapid battery drain as it could have been faulty batteries. The sonde was deployed for a week in the lab with no data collection or battery power issues. Therefore, it appears it was a bad batch of batteries.

    "text": "Understanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

    "text": "6.2 Nor’easters\nTypically, a Nor’easter is a storm along the East Coast of the United States with predominating winds from the northeast. These storms can last anywhere from a single day (24 hours) to several days or weeks. Callahan, Leathers, and Callahan (2022) found that these events can produce surges just as severe as tropical cyclone events, and occur much more frequently. These events are often in the news associated with blizzards in the New England area of the US; however, their impacts to northeast Florida are not insignificant. Often these storms bring higher water levels, heavy prevailing winds, precipitation, and reduced tidal exchange.\nUsing duration of wind directions between 0-100 degrees for greater than 24-hrs, one “Nor’easter” event was identified using data from the Pellicer Creek weather station (Table 6.1). Occasionally, localized wind directions result in values outside of this 0-100 degree window. The longest Nor’easter event occurred March 24th - March 25th, lasting 33 hours (Figure 6.4). This table does not identify strength of the winds during these events, just the time frames in which winds were originating and prevailing in the 0-100 degree directions (Figure 6.1).\nAdditionally, northeast Florida felt the impacts of an unofficially named winter storm, Finn. Strong winds were predicted for the event as well as heavy localized rain. Saint Johns County was considered in an Enhanced Risk area (level 3 of 5) with strong southerly winds and the potential for tornadoes. Local schools were released early and government offices closed early in preparation for the fast moving storm. The Pellicer Creek weather station recorded over 23 mm of rain (Figure 4.1 (c)) and had a maximum wind speed of 28.9 mph (Figure 6.6 (b)).\nAnother strong storm passed through the area on February 6th. This storm brought a lot of rain, hail and high winds to Northeast Florida. The National Weather Service confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in Jacksonville as a result of the extreme storm system. Surprisingly, the Pellicer Creek weather station did not record any rain from the event but it did record high winds. The winds were predominately from the north and the maximum wind speed was 32.7 mph (Figure 6.7). Strong winds initially raised salinity at all stations (Figure 4.5), and the effect was especially pronounced at Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.5 (d)).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1:  Identification and Duration of Wind from 0-100 degrees for periods greater than 24 hours \n \n  \n    Start Time \n    End Time \n    Duration (hrs) \n  \n \n\n  \n    2024-03-24 01:00:00 \n    2024-03-25 09:45:00 \n    33 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Daily median wind speeds observed in 2024 at the Pellicer Creek weather station.

    "text": "6.3 King Tides\n“King Tides” are the highest predicted tides of the year and in northeast Florida, these typically occur during the fall months. For the city of St. Augustine, these events often bring nuisance flooding in coastal and low-lying areas. For the estuary, this typically also means reduced tidal exchange, a lack of low tide events, and more and prolonged flooding in the intertidal wetlands. The city reports these events on their website.\nPredicted king tide events for quarter one of 2024 were:\n\nJanuary 11th-13th\n\nThe effect of the King Tides on daily average water depths at all the stations is observable in the steady climb of the water beginning in mid-September (Figure 6.8); however, the individual “events” are not quite as clear outside of the Pellicer Creek station (Figure 6.8 (d)) where clear increases in water levels are closely aligned with these periods. Unfortunately, September King Tide, which was coupled with a Nor’easter, was not captured at this station due to equipment maintenance issues.\n\n6.3.1 Water Depth\nNote that the water level data at Pellicer Creek only includes data from 2021-2024, which is due to this station switching from reporting depth to reporting level (NAVD88) in 2021 (Figure 6.8 (d)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Historical daily range of water depth at each SWMP water quality station with current year daily average overlaid in blue."

Since failure occured prior to deployment, data were collected during the entire deployment (March 7, 2024 10:00 – April 9, 2024 11:30) and post deployment procedures were not conducted. The data sonde was taken out of rotation and sent to Xylem/YSI for repairs."

The PC telemetry station was reporting low battery voltage in February and March. On April 2, 2024 research staff successfully replaced the battery at the telemetry station. Staff confirmed that the power supply elevated after the exchange.\nIn January 2024 the battery voltage on Pellicer Creek sonde, Egret, increased during the deployment which is uncommon. This same battery issue repeated itself each time this sonde was deployed in February and March. In early April when the sonde was getting calibrated the KOR software notified the technician that the datasonde’s internal RTC battery aka coin cell had low voltage. Staff called Xylem/YSI tech support and was told to send the data sonde in for repairs."

In 2019, collections for Enterococcus bacteria began and both are now collected at all four stations. Due to overnight shipping requirements, all bacteria samples are qualified by the DEP laboratory as out of hold times. For proper analyses, hold times for these samples are not to exceed 7 hours from collection. Therefore, the SWMP uses this data to show general patterns and trends only."
